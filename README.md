# Tesla App

Initial concept app to talk to a Tesla car via the API.
Is currently working against the mock server supplied at [http://docs.timdorr.apiary.io/#reference](http://docs.timdorr.apiary.io/#reference)

## Get it running

Clone the repo, and run the index.html file using your favourite server; i.e. http-server

## What does it do?

Not too much yet!!

It currently gets the access token from the mock server; and gets the vehicles associated to this token.

You can then command the selected vehicle using the buttons provided and see whether it worked in the results panel.

## To Do

- [ ] Improve load UX
- [ ] Allow you to enter you real credentials to talk to the real Tesla API
- [ ] Handle responses more thoroughly, currently limited to the responses I've seen from the mock server!
- [ ] Add more commands/functions to control the car(s)
